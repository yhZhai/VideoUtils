# VideoUtils

Video utilities to extract RGB frames and optical flow images from raw video and save them into h5 files, and extract RGB and flow snippet-level features from the saved h5 files.

## TODO

- [ ] Add detailed usage guide.
- [ ] Add feature extraction code.

## Usage

1. Follow [instructions from denseflow](https://github.com/open-mmlab/denseflow/blob/master/INSTALL.md) to setup the environment.
2. The command is the same with [denseflow](https://github.com/open-mmlab/denseflow), except setting `--out-format h5` will save the output images as h5 files.
